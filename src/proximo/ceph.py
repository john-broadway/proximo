Schema truth: `.scratch/api-schemas-2026-07-15/wave6-pve-ceph-schema.json` (37 paths, 48
methods, extracted from the live PVE apidoc pulled 2026-07-15). NONE of these 42 tools are
live-verified yet — no Ceph cluster exists in the sealed vmbr1 lab today; every backend method
(`backends.py`) carries its own Smoke-confirm comment. This module holds the mutation plan
factories only (the 20 reads across all four waves have no plan — mirrors `apt.py`).

**`/nodes/{node}/ceph/status` is a DOCUMENTED alias** of `/cluster/ceph/status` (schema:
"cluster-wide and identical … node-level alias exists for operator convenience"). Proximo builds
ONLY the cluster form (`pve_ceph_status`) — the node alias is intentionally not built (the 5d
gc path-alias precedent: one tool per distinct wire call, not one per URL).

**UNDO HONESTY:** nothing on this plane is PVE-snapshottable — no rollback primitive exists
(same class as firewall/SDN/ACL). `pve_ceph_flags_set`/`pve_ceph_flag_set` CAPTURE-or-declare
the prior flag state into the plan; revert is "re-apply the captured values with this same
tool," never an automatic rollback.

**Risk:** both mutations are RISK_MEDIUM — flag semantics vary per flag: `pause` halts ALL
client I/O to the cluster; `noout`/`noscrub`/etc. are routine maintenance toggles. The docstring
carries this honesty line verbatim rather than implying a single uniform blast radius.

**cmd-safety is ADVISORY, never a gate** (schema: "Heuristical check"). `pve_ceph_cmd_safety`
is built here as a standalone read tool in this chunk; wiring it in as cited evidence inside a
mon/mds/osd destroy/stop plan is chunk 6b/6c's job (those plans don't exist yet in 6a) — when
they land, an unreachable cmd-safety check must degrade to an honest "cmd-safety unavailable:
<err>" line, never a fabricated `safe=true`, and never block plan rendering (fail-open by
design: a plan must still render when Ceph itself is unhealthy).

**Taint — argued, not asserted (Wave 6a adversarial review Finding 2, 2026-07-16):**

- **`pve_ceph_log` is ADVERSARIAL** (`taint.ADVERSARIAL_TOOLS`) — free-text log lines (`{n, t}`),
  Sys.Syslog-channel content, same rationale as `pve_node_journal`/`pve_node_syslog`. Not a
  contested call.
- **`pve_ceph_metadata` is ADVERSARIAL** (reclassified by the Wave 6a review; it shipped
  REVIEWED_TRUSTED originally, which didn't survive challenge). The schema types every
  per-instance mon/mgr/mds entry `"additionalProperties": 1` — an explicitly OPEN shape, not a
  closed structured record — and the documented fields include `hostname`, `addr`/`addrs`, and
  `name`, all **self-reported by each daemon at registration**, not typed in by the operator. The
  counter-argument for REVIEWED_TRUSTED would be: unlike a remote PBS (a genuinely separate
  administrative domain), Ceph mon/mgr/mds/osd daemons are part of the SAME cluster the operator
  already administers — if an attacker has compromised one badly enough to forge its `hostname`,
  they already hold a much stronger lever (arbitrary `ceph.conf`/mon-command access) than a
  spoofed metadata string. That's a real distinction, but `taint.py`'s own controlling rule is
  that **classification is by CONTENT CHANNEL, not by who chose (or already controls) the
  target** — the same rule that lands `pbs_s3_list_buckets`/`pbs_remote_scan` in
  `ADVERSARIAL_TOOLS` despite their own targets being operator-configured/same-domain too. A
  rogue or compromised daemon controls `hostname`/`addr`/`name` the same way a compromised remote
  PBS controls its store names/comments — "whoever controls it controls these bytes" — aggregated
  across every node in the cluster into the calling agent's context, unfiltered. Bias
  conservative per taint.py's own stated policy: classify as adversarial when unsure.
- **`pve_ceph_status` STAYS REVIEWED_TRUSTED** — argued, not just asserted, despite its own vague
  `{"type": "object"}` schema shape (zero documented properties; the module's own Smoke-confirm
  note above concedes the shape isn't live-verified). The distinguishing fact is the SAME
  same-admin-domain point raised above for metadata, but here it actually carries the
  classification: `ceph status`/`ceph -s` is a structured cluster-health SUMMARY (health/monmap/
  osdmap/pgmap), template-generated by ceph-mgr — a same-admin-domain daemon the operator already
  trusts to report cluster state, not an open per-instance registry of individually-addressable
  daemon-controlled strings. The free-text/open channels on THIS plane are `pve_ceph_log`
  (explicit free text) and `pve_ceph_metadata` (open per-instance self-report) — both classified
  ADVERSARIAL above; `pve_ceph_status` carries neither shape.
- `pve_ceph_cmd_safety`'s `status` field ("human-readable status message from Ceph") is the same
  class of daemon-generated advisory prose, but unlike metadata's open per-instance map it's a
  single bounded field describing ONE specific stop/destroy check the caller itself requested
  (action+service+id), and the tool is documented ADVISORY-ONLY — never a gate — so even a
  maximally hostile `status` string cannot do more than mis-describe a check result the caller
  must not act on unverified anyway. REVIEWED_TRUSTED stands.
- `flags-list`/`flag-get`/`cfg_db`/`cfg_raw`/`cfg_value`/`crush`/`rules` are closed-shape,
  operator-authored structured data (`cfg_raw`/`cfg_db` carry ceph.conf content — matches the
  `pbs_node_config_get` config-read precedent) -> REVIEWED_TRUSTED, uncontested. Both mutations
  (`flags_set`/`flag_set`) return either an opaque UPID or null — no content channel at all.

**Wave 6b — services lifecycle (2026-07-16).** Extends the module above; nothing in Wave 6a
changes. New: `pve_ceph_{mon,mgr,mds}_list`, `pve_ceph_{mon,mgr,mds}_{create,destroy}`,
`pve_ceph_init`, `pve_ceph_service_{start,stop,restart}`.

**Build nuance — the id path segment resolves the "default: nodename" locally.** The live schema
lists `monid` (mon POST), `id` (mgr POST), and `name` (mds POST) as `"optional": 1` params with
`"default": "nodename"` — but each is ALSO the URL path segment (`/nodes/{node}/ceph/mon/{monid}`
etc.), which cannot itself be "omitted" from an HTTP request. The flat api-viewer schema documents
path segments and true body/query params identically inside one `parameters` block, so this
"optional with a default" only makes sense as documentation for whoever constructs the request:
the CALLER (us) must resolve monid/id/name to the nodename before building the URL when the
caller passed none. `backends.py`'s `_ceph_daemon_target()` does this once, shared by all three
CREATE methods. DESTROY (DELETE) declares no `optional`/`default` on the same param at all — it
is genuinely required there (PVE cannot guess which existing instance to destroy).

**`mgr_id` avoids shadowing the `id` builtin** (the schema's own param name) — same rename
precedent as Wave 6a's `cmd-safety` `id` -> `service_id`. `mon`/`mds` don't need the rename
(`monid`/`name` are already non-shadowing).

**cmd-safety citation matrix (fail-open ADVISORY, never a gate — Wave 6a's own posture, now
actually wired in as promised):**

- `mon_destroy` — YES: `action=destroy, service=mon, id=<monid>` (mon is in the cmd-safety enum
  `{osd, mon, mds}`).
- `mds_destroy` — YES: `action=destroy, service=mds, id=<name>` (mds is in the enum).
- `mgr_destroy` — **NO.** The plan states plainly "no upstream cmd-safety check exists for mgr":
  cmd-safety's service enum is `{osd, mon, mds}` — mgr was never in it; inventing a check would
  fabricate coverage that doesn't exist upstream.
- `service_stop` — CONDITIONAL: cited only when `service` parses to a `mon.<id>`/`mds.<id>`/
  `osd.<id>` shape (kind in the enum AND a specific instance id present). A bare kind (`mon`, no
  id), `ceph`/`ceph.target`, or `mgr` has no single instance for cmd-safety to evaluate — the
  plan states "no cmd-safety check available" rather than guessing an id.
- `mon_create`/`mgr_create`/`mds_create`/`init`/`service_start`/`service_restart` — NO.
  cmd-safety only covers `stop`/`destroy` actions (schema enum) — start/restart/create have no
  upstream heuristic to cite.

Every citation attempt is wrapped in try/except: an unreachable/erroring cmd-safety call
degrades to `"cmd-safety unavailable: <ExceptionType>: <msg>"` in the plan's blast_radius, NEVER
blocks the plan, and NEVER fabricates `safe=true`. `_cmd_safety_note()` below is the shared helper.

**CAPTURE-or-declare (the 6a flags precedent, extended):** `mon_create`/`mon_destroy`,
`mgr_create`/`mgr_destroy`, `mds_create`/`mds_destroy` each best-effort read the matching
`ceph_{mon,mgr,mds}_list()` and look up the target id by `name` — a successful read that simply
finds no match degrades to `current={}` (honest — e.g. a create's target doesn't exist yet), not
a failure; only a raised exception on the read itself sets `complete=False`. `pve_ceph_init` gets
NO capture (mirrors `plan_apt_update_refresh`'s own "no meaningful current state to snapshot"
posture — there is no single "current init state" resource to read). `service_{start,stop,
restart}` also get no capture — there is no durable "is `ceph.target` currently running" read
built on this plane to snapshot from.

**Taint — mon/mgr/mds LIST tools are ADVERSARIAL, extending the Wave 6a review's metadata
reasoning (not narrowing it):** `pve_ceph_mon_list`/`pve_ceph_mgr_list`/`pve_ceph_mds_list`
return per-instance `name`/`host`/`addr`/`ceph_version` fields — the SAME daemon-self-reported
identity strings that made `pve_ceph_metadata` ADVERSARIAL in the Wave 6a review, just sliced by
service type instead of aggregated across all four. The counter-argument (closed-shape: these
schemas name every field explicitly, no `additionalProperties: 1` the way metadata's per-instance
entries do) is real and was weighed — but the controlling rule stays `taint.py`'s own: "channel,
not by who chose the target." A rogue/compromised mon/mgr/mds daemon controls `addr`/`host`/
`name` in the per-type list the identical way it controls those same fields inside the aggregated
metadata view — the JSON container shape (open vs. closed) changes how PVE happens to present the
bytes, not who authored them. Classifying the list view REVIEWED_TRUSTED while the aggregate view
stays ADVERSARIAL would be an inconsistent channel call for functionally identical content, and
`taint.py`'s own HONEST LIMITS section states the tie-break explicitly: "bias conservative...
classify as adversarial when unsure." All 10 mutations (create/destroy/init/service_*) stay
REVIEWED_TRUSTED — each returns only an opaque UPID or null, no content channel at all (same
reasoning as `flags_set`/`flag_set`).

**Taint fix (Wave 6b adversarial review Finding 1, post-review):** the 6 mon/mgr/mds
create/destroy plan factories' CAPTURE reads call `api.ceph_{mon,mgr,mds}_list()` directly — the
SAME ADVERSARIAL-classified content the paragraph above argues for, but reached WITHOUT going
through the wrapped read tool or `_audited()`, so it originally bypassed taint marking and ledger
provenance-stamping entirely. Fixed by routing every one of those 6 CAPTURE reads through
`taint.capture_adversarial_current()` — the shared helper marks the sticky taint marker (when
taint tracking is enabled) and stamps the captured entry landing in `Plan.current` (and therefore
the ledger's "planned" entry, which writes `Plan.current` verbatim) with the same
`{"untrusted": True, "content_trust": "adversarial"}` annotation `_audited()` applies. See
`taint.py`'s `capture_adversarial_current` docstring for the full mechanism.

**UNDO honesty (unchanged from Wave 6a):** no rollback primitive on this plane. `mon_destroy`
reverts via a fresh `mon_create` with the same `monid` — a NEW monitor, not a byte-for-byte
restore of the destroyed one's internal state — and every mutation docstring says so plainly.

**Risk (per the campaign brief, `.scratch/2026-07-15-full-surface-campaign.md` "Wave 6
decomposition"):** `init`/`mon_create`/`mgr_create`/`mds_create`/`service_start`/
`service_restart` = RISK_MEDIUM. `mon_destroy`/`mgr_destroy`/`mds_destroy`/`service_stop` =
RISK_HIGH (quorum/metadata-service loss for the destroys; `service_stop` halts live storage
daemons).

---

**Wave 6c — OSD (2026-07-16).** Extends the module above; nothing in Wave 6a/6b changes. New:
`pve_ceph_osd_tree`, `pve_ceph_osd_lv_info`, `pve_ceph_osd_metadata`, `pve_ceph_osd_create`,
`pve_ceph_osd_destroy`, `pve_ceph_osd_in`, `pve_ceph_osd_out`, `pve_ceph_osd_scrub`.

**osdid=0 is a VALID id (the falsy-id lesson, Wave 6b Finding 2, applied to a numeric id).**
Every osdid check in this chunk (`_check_ceph_osdid` in backends.py, `_find_osd_in_tree` below)
uses isinstance+equality, NEVER truthiness — `osdid=0` (the first OSD ever created) must never
be mistaken for "missing" anywhere on this plane.

**Taint — argued per tool, extending the established channel rule:**

- **`pve_ceph_osd_tree` is ADVERSARIAL.** The schema types the ENTIRE nested CRUSH-bucket
  response `additionalProperties: 1` (open, untyped) — an even more extreme "cannot statically
  say what's in here" shape than `pve_ceph_metadata`'s own per-instance open map — and its
  documented per-node properties (status/weight/in/usage/latencies/...) are daemon-self-reported
  telemetry flowing back through the same monitor-cluster channel that made metadata/mon-list/
  mgr-list/mds-list ADVERSARIAL. Not a contested call.
- **`pve_ceph_osd_metadata` is ADVERSARIAL.** Its `osd{}` sub-object carries `hostname`/
  `back_addr`/`front_addr`/`hb_back_addr`/`hb_front_addr` — literally the SAME daemon-self-
  reported identity/address field SET that made the aggregated `pve_ceph_metadata` ADVERSARIAL
  in Wave 6a. This is that exact channel's single-OSD drill-down (the same relationship
  `pve_ceph_mon_list`/etc. bore to the aggregate metadata view in Wave 6b), not a fresh judgment
  call.
- **`pve_ceph_osd_lv_info` STAYS REVIEWED_TRUSTED — argued, not defaulted, against the two
  precedents above.** Its schema is CLOSED-shape (no `additionalProperties: 1` — every field
  named: `creation_time`/`lv_name`/`lv_path`/`lv_size`/`lv_uuid`/`vg_name`). The CHANNEL differs
  on the axis `taint.py`'s own rule actually cares about: this content is sourced from a LOCAL
  `lvs` shell-out on the SAME host administering the OSD, not a cross-daemon network self-report
  exchanged at cluster registration. The counter-argument (an attacker who has already forged a
  rogue LV to poison `lv_name`/`vg_name` controls those bytes the same way a rogue daemon
  controls `hostname`) does not survive on TWO independent grounds, not one (Wave 6c review
  strengthening, 2026-07-16 — the "requires root" ground alone doesn't rule out a non-root daemon
  writing malicious data through some other channel; this second ground is the sharper, more
  load-bearing one): (1) forging local LVM metadata on a host already REQUIRES root/host-level
  compromise on that specific node — a materially stronger foothold than a compromised/rogue
  MON/MGR/MDS/OSD daemon merely joining the cluster with a leaked cephx key (the threat model
  that drove metadata/list/osd_tree/osd_metadata ADVERSARIAL); (2) even granting some non-root
  compromise, `lv_name`/`vg_name` are not operator-typed or daemon-rewritable free strings in the
  first place — `ceph-volume lvm create/prepare` auto-generates them as UUID-derived identifiers
  (e.g. `ceph-<uuid>`/`osd-block-<uuid>`) at OSD-creation time, and the running `ceph-osd` daemon
  does not rewrite them during normal operation, so a routinely-compromised (non-root) OSD daemon
  process cannot steer an arbitrary string into these fields just by being compromised — a root
  escalation is the only lever that reaches them at all. This lands `pve_ceph_osd_lv_info` in the
  SAME class as `cfg_raw`/`cfg_db` (Wave 6a's local-config-read precedent), not the
  registration-handshake class above. Reviewer challenge welcome, per the same posture Wave 6a
  extended to `cfg_raw`/`cfg_db`.
- The 5 mutations (`osd_create`/`osd_destroy`/`osd_in`/`osd_out`/`osd_scrub`) all stay
  REVIEWED_TRUSTED — each returns only an opaque UPID or null, no content channel at all (same
  reasoning as every prior mutation on this plane).

**CAPTURE-or-declare + the nested-tree extension:** `osd_destroy`/`osd_in`/`osd_out` each
best-effort read the CRUSH tree (`pve_ceph_osd_tree`, ADVERSARIAL) and look up the target osdid's
leaf entry — through `taint.capture_adversarial_current`, exactly like Wave 6b's mon/mgr/mds
factories, so the SAME taint-marking/ledger-provenance-stamping applies. The tree is a NESTED
structure (root -> children -> ... -> leaves), not a flat list, so the helper's default flat-list
`key`-equality lookup doesn't fit — `capture_adversarial_current` was extended (compatibly; every
Wave 6b caller is byte-for-byte unchanged) with an optional `finder=` callable; `_find_osd_in_tree`
below is passed as that `finder`. A successful read with no matching leaf degrades to
`current={}` (honest — e.g. the OSD may already be gone), not a failure; only a raised exception
on the read itself sets `complete=False`. `osd_create` gets NO capture — it creates a BRAND-NEW
OSD, nothing existing to snapshot (mirrors `plan_apt_update_refresh`'s own "no capture" posture).
`osd_scrub` also gets no capture — scrubbing isn't a durable state to snapshot (mirrors
`plan_ceph_service_start`'s own "nothing to capture" posture).

**cmd-safety citation matrix, extended:**

- `osd_destroy` — YES: `action=destroy, service=osd, id=str(osdid)` (osd is in the cmd-safety
  enum `{osd, mon, mds}`; `service_id` is typed string on that endpoint, so `osdid` is stringified
  for the call).
- `osd_in`/`osd_out` — **NO for BOTH.** cmd-safety's `action` enum is `{stop, destroy}` — neither
  'in' nor 'out' is either one: 'in'/'out' toggle CRUSH acting-set membership without stopping the
  OSD daemon or destroying anything. Both plans state this plainly rather than guessing or
  fabricating coverage (mirrors `mgr_destroy`'s own honest "no check exists" posture from Wave 6b,
  applied here to an action-enum mismatch instead of a service-enum one).
- `osd_create`/`osd_scrub` — NO. cmd-safety only covers `stop`/`destroy` actions; create/scrub
  have no upstream heuristic to cite (same reasoning as `mon_create`/`init`/`service_start` in
  Wave 6b).

**`osd_create`'s device-path validation is a deliberate, stricter-than-schema choice, Ceph-scoped
(Wave 6c review Finding 1, MAJOR, 2026-07-16 fix)** (see `backends.ceph_osd_create`'s docstring):
`dev`/`db_dev`/`wal_dev` are validated with `_check_ceph_osd_dev` — a Ceph-scoped WIDENING of the
shared `_check_disk` block-device-path validator PVE's node-disks plane uses, NOT a loosening of
`_check_disk` itself (`node_disk_wipe`/`node_disk_initgpt` keep relying on its stricter shape).
THIS schema declares no format/pattern for any of the three params, but a stricter-than-schema
tightening for the single highest-risk mutation on this whole plane (a malformed device string
here formats real hardware) is still worth doing — the first-shipped version simply reused
`_check_disk` verbatim and was too strict for its own highest-risk mutation: its
`[a-zA-Z0-9/_-]` charset rejected real-world, PVE-documented, commonly-recommended stable device
paths (e.g. `/dev/disk/by-id/nvme-eui.<hex>`, `/dev/disk/by-path/pci-<bus>:<dev>.<fn>-...`) that
are specifically relevant here (`osds-per-device`'s own description: "Only useful for fast NVMe
devices") and that operators reach for on THIS plane precisely to avoid `/dev/sdX` renumbering.
`_check_ceph_osd_dev` widens the charset to admit `.`, `:`, `+`, `=` (still a conservative
WHITELIST — whitespace/backslashes/shell metacharacters stay excluded by construction) while
keeping the `/dev/` prefix requirement and the `..`-traversal check. `crush_device_class` stays
unvalidated (free-form label, no schema pattern — mirrors `mon_address`'s own "no regex given,
don't invent one" posture). `db_dev_size` REQUIRES `db_dev`;
`wal_dev_size` REQUIRES `wal_dev` (both schema `"requires"`, enforced client-side exactly like
Wave 6b's `cluster_network` requires `network`). `osds-per-device`'s "mutually exclusive with
db_dev/wal_dev" is PROSE in the schema's own param description, not a formal requires/conflicts
field — enforced here anyway (fail fast locally rather than a guaranteed upstream rejection),
flagged explicitly since it's a step beyond the literal schema constraints.

**UNDO honesty (unchanged):** no rollback primitive on this plane. `osd_destroy` reverts via a
fresh `osd_create` — a NEW OSD with a DIFFERENT id and no data continuity, not a byte-for-byte
restore. `osd_create` itself does not return the new OSD's id synchronously (only a worker-task
UPID) — the id is only discoverable afterward via `pve_ceph_osd_tree`.

**Risk:** `osd_create`/`osd_destroy` = RISK_HIGH (consumes/formats a device; destroys an OSD —
data-durability risk). `osd_in`/`osd_out` = RISK_MEDIUM (both trigger data rebalance/recovery,
just in opposite directions). `osd_scrub` = RISK_LOW (no logical state change; a deep scrub is
I/O-heavy while it runs, but that is a performance concern, not a state-change one).

---

**Wave 6d — pools + CephFS (2026-07-16, CLOSES Wave 6).** Extends the module above; nothing in
Wave 6a/6b/6c changes. New: `pve_ceph_pool_list`, `pve_ceph_pool_status`, `pve_ceph_pool_create`,
`pve_ceph_pool_set`, `pve_ceph_pool_destroy`, `pve_ceph_fs_list`, `pve_ceph_fs_create`,
`pve_ceph_fs_destroy`. The per-pool `GET /pool/{name}` and the per-item directory-index GETs are
pure child-link stubs (schema: "Pool index."/"Directory index.") — NOT built, per the campaign
brief's own "5 directory stubs" disposition list; the real per-pool read is
`GET .../pool/{name}/status`.

**Schema divergences worth flagging (build-time findings, not defects):**

- **Wire param-name inconsistency between pool and fs, same wave, same upstream author (PVE,
  not Proximo) — verified against the raw schema JSON, not assumed:** pool create/destroy use
  UNDERSCORE param names (`add_storages`, `remove_ecprofile`, `remove_storages`); fs
  create/destroy use HYPHENATED param names (`add-storage`, `remove-pools`, `remove-storages`).
  `backends.py`'s wire-body dict keys match each endpoint's OWN literal wire name exactly —
  Python-side kwargs stay underscore-named throughout for both, per this codebase's own
  convention; only the WIRE body differs.
- **`crush_rule` is two different types depending on direction — but ONLY for `pool_list`, not
  `pool_status` (corrected, Wave 6d review Finding 2, 2026-07-17: the original claim blanketed
  both under "the READ side," which is wrong for one of the two — verified against the raw
  schema JSON, not assumed).** `pve_ceph_pool_list`'s `crush_rule` really is the numeric CRUSH
  rule id (`crush_rule: integer`, title "Crush Rule") plus a separate human-readable
  `crush_rule_name: string`. `pve_ceph_pool_status`'s `crush_rule` is ALREADY a string
  (`crush_rule: string`, title "Crush Rule Name" — the identical title `pool_create`/`pool_set`
  use for their own write-side param) and carries no separate `crush_rule_name` field at all — it
  matches the write side exactly, no round-trip hazard exists for `pool_status`. Only
  `pve_ceph_pool_list`'s read value diverges from what `pve_ceph_pool_create`/`pve_ceph_pool_set`
  accept; docstrings say so explicitly, scoped to `pool_list` alone, so a caller doesn't try to
  round-trip THAT read value straight back into a write call.
- **`pg_num_min` is upper-bounded ONLY** (schema: `maximum: 32768`, no `minimum` key at all — the
  live typetext is literally `<integer> (-N - 32768)`), unlike `pg_num`/`min_size`/`size` which
  are bounded both ways. `_check_ceph_pool_upper_bound` (backends.py) validates accordingly — a
  new one-sided validator, not a reuse of `_check_ceph_init_bound` (which requires both a lo and
  a hi).
- **`erasure-coding` is PVE's own propertyString wire format**
  (`k=<int>,m=<int>[,device-class=<class>][,failure-domain=<domain>][,profile=<profile>]`) —
  Proximo does NOT invent a nested-object param for this one field on this one endpoint; the
  caller passes the SAME string PVE's own tooling would send, and
  `_check_ceph_pool_erasure_coding` (backends.py) validates it by PARSING (required k>=2/m>=1,
  closed field set, no duplicates) before passing the original string through unchanged.
  `failure-domain`'s own schema default ('host') and `device-class`/`profile`'s optionality are
  left to PVE server-side — Proximo does not second-guess them.
- **`pve_ceph_fs_create`'s `name` schema-defaults to the FIXED LITERAL `'cephfs'`** — a
  DIFFERENT default-resolution shape than Wave 6b's mon/mgr/mds `default: nodename` (there, the
  id resolves to the CALLER'S node name; here it resolves to a hardcoded string). Both are
  client-side-resolved for the identical mechanical reason (the id/name is ALSO the URL path
  segment and cannot itself be "omitted" from an HTTP request) — `_check_ceph_fs_name_or_default`
  (backends.py) is the Wave 6d analog of `_ceph_daemon_target`.

**Taint — REVERSED post-ship (Wave 6d review Finding 1, 2026-07-17; the ruling below is the
CORRECTED final state, superseding what shipped originally — see `.scratch/sdd/wave-6d-report.md`
"Fixes applied (post-review)" for the strike-and-correct on the original claim):**

- **`pve_ceph_pool_list`/`pve_ceph_pool_status`/`pve_ceph_fs_list` are ADVERSARIAL**
  (`taint.ADVERSARIAL_TOOLS`) — this chunk originally shipped them REVIEWED_TRUSTED, arguing
  every field was either operator-chosen config or a cluster-computed summary, the same class
  that keeps `pve_ceph_status` REVIEWED_TRUSTED. That argument didn't survive challenge on three
  grounds:
  1. **The closest, most damaging precedent in this same codebase was never engaged.**
     `taint.py`'s own `ADVERSARIAL_TOOLS` already classifies `pve_list_guests`/
     `pve_cluster_resources`/`pve_snapshot_list` ADVERSARIAL with the stated reason
     "operator-set, but free-text fields a guest/attacker can shape." `pool_name` (POST
     `.../pool`) and CephFS `name` (POST `.../fs/{name}`) both validate against the pattern
     `^[^:/\\s]+$` ONLY — no length cap at all (unlike Wave 6b's mds `name`, which carries
     `maxLength: 200`) — and are creatable by ANY cephx-capable client holding mon caps, not only
     through Proximo's own `pool_create`/`fs_create`; Ceph itself also auto-creates pools with no
     operator action at all (`device_health_metrics`, `.mgr`). That is structurally identical to
     the VM/CT/snapshot-name precedent, which this chunk's original argument never mentioned.
  2. **`application_metadata` is a third channel the original operator-chosen/cluster-computed
     dichotomy never covered.** It's populated by `ceph osd pool application set <pool> <app>
     <key> <value>` — a raw Ceph admin command entirely OUTSIDE `pve_ceph_pool_create`/
     `pve_ceph_pool_set` (neither exposes an application-metadata key/value parameter at all).
     Proximo mediates neither the write nor any cluster-computed derivation of it — it is neither
     "operator-chosen through this surface" nor "cluster-computed," the two buckets the original
     argument relied on exhaustively.
  3. **Two of the original argument's own supporting schema citations were false, verified by
     parsing the raw schema JSON directly, not visual read.** The original text claimed
     `application_metadata`/`autoscale_status` "ARE schema-open (`additionalProperties: 1`, ...
     same as metadata's per-instance entries)" and that `pve_ceph_fs_list` "is narrower still — no
     `additionalProperties: 1` sub-object anywhere." Both are backwards:
     `pool_list.returns.items`, `pool_list.returns.items.properties.application_metadata`/
     `.autoscale_status`, and `pool_status.returns` (top level) carry NO `additionalProperties`
     key at all; the ONLY `"additionalProperties": 1` anywhere in the schema's pool/fs section
     sits at line 904, on `pve_ceph_fs_list`'s OWN per-entry object
     (`GET /nodes/{node}/ceph/fs` returns.items) — i.e. **fs_list's own entry is the schema-open
     one**, the exact inverse of what shipped. Given `pve_ceph_metadata`'s own precedent (this
     module's Wave 6a section: `additionalProperties: 1` on a per-instance entry is material
     evidence toward ADVERSARIAL, "an explicitly OPEN shape, not a closed structured record") —
     the identical marker `fs_list` carries and was claimed not to.

  Corrected verdict for all three: bias conservative per `taint.py`'s own stated policy ("classify
  as adversarial when unsure"). `pool_name`/`name` are attacker-shapeable free-text fields set
  through a channel Proximo doesn't fully control (a rogue cephx client, or Ceph's own
  auto-creation), landing them the same way `pve_list_guests`/`pve_snapshot_list` already landed;
  `application_metadata` is externally-authored content over an operator-configured channel (the
  `pbs_s3_list_buckets`/`pbs_remote_scan` shape, not the `pve_ceph_status` shape); and `fs_list`'s
  own schema-open marker cuts the same direction `pve_ceph_metadata` already established.
- The 5 mutations (`pool_create`/`pool_set`/`pool_destroy`/`fs_create`/`fs_destroy`) stay
  REVIEWED_TRUSTED — each returns only an opaque UPID, no content channel at all (same reasoning
  as every prior mutation on this plane). Unaffected by the reversal above.

**CAPTURE-or-declare — through `taint.capture_adversarial_current` (corrected, Wave 6d review
Finding 1 fix):** since `pve_ceph_pool_list`/`pve_ceph_pool_status`/`pve_ceph_fs_list` are
ADVERSARIAL by the ruling above, all 5 mutations' CAPTURE reads (`pool_create`/`pool_destroy`
read `ceph_pool_list()`; `fs_create`/`fs_destroy` read `ceph_fs_list()`; `pool_set` reads
`ceph_pool_status(name)`) were rewired from a plain try/except onto
`taint.capture_adversarial_current` — the SAME fix Wave 6b's own review applied to the mon/mgr/mds
create/destroy factories, reopened here for a different plane (exactly the gap the Wave 6d
review's Finding 1 called out in advance: "the CAPTURE wiring in five plan factories needs to
change ... exactly the compound the review brief called out"). `pool_create`/`pool_destroy` pass
`key="pool_name"` (the default lookup's `key=` param, since the pool entry's match field isn't
named `name`); `fs_create`/`fs_destroy` use the default `key="name"` unchanged. `pool_set` is the
first caller whose CAPTURE source (`ceph_pool_status`) returns a single dict, not a list — its
`finder` returns that dict verbatim (ignoring `match_id`) instead of searching a collection,
closer to what "revert by reapplying the captured current values" actually needs (the full
current settings object, not a list-entry fragment), the same reasoning `plan_ceph_flag_set`
already applies by reading `ceph_flag_get` directly instead of scanning `ceph_flags_list` (that
source stays REVIEWED_TRUSTED, so it keeps its own plain try/except — unaffected by this fix). A
successful read with no match (pool_create/pool_destroy/fs_create/fs_destroy) degrades to
`current={}` (expected for a create; honest-but-gone for a destroy), NOT a failure — only a
raised exception on the read itself sets `complete=False`. All 5 factories now take a required
keyword-only `audit_dir: str` param (threaded from `tools/pve_ceph.py`'s wrappers via
`os.path.dirname(audit.path)`, the same computation `_audited()` already uses), mirroring the
Wave 6b/6c mon/mgr/mds/osd factories' own shape exactly.

**cmd-safety does NOT cover this plane at all:** cmd-safety's `service` enum is
`{osd, mon, mds}` — it covers NONE of pool or filesystem. Every plan below states this plainly
(the Wave 6b `mgr_destroy` honesty precedent, applied here to an entire plane instead of one
service type) rather than inventing a check or silently omitting the point.

**`pool_destroy`'s `force` is NEVER defaulted on** — forwarded to the wire ONLY when the caller
explicitly sets it (schema: "destroys pool even if in use"), mirroring `osd_destroy`'s `cleanup`
precedent exactly.

**UNDO honesty:** nothing on this plane is PVE-snapshottable — no rollback primitive exists (same
class as every other Ceph mutation). `pool_destroy`/`fs_destroy` are UNRECOVERABLE via the API:
recreating a pool/filesystem with the SAME name does NOT restore the destroyed data (a fresh
empty pool/fs, not a byte-for-byte restore) — the same honesty `osd_destroy` already carries for
OSD data. `pool_set` reverts by re-applying the captured prior settings with this same tool
(mirrors `flag_set`).

**Risk:** `pool_create`/`fs_create` = RISK_MEDIUM (new capacity/service, no existing data at
stake). `pool_set` = RISK_MEDIUM (a `pg_num` change triggers cluster rebalance — docstring says
so plainly). `pool_destroy`/`fs_destroy` = RISK_HIGH (irreversibly destroys the pool/filesystem
and, depending on flags, the underlying data too).
